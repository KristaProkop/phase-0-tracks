# Git Definitions
Here is another line added for the next challenge.

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control is a system for keeping files and workflows organized. Version control allows developers to easily make and track changes and revert back in the event of bugs or changing strategies. It also allows many people to work on one project at once without losing track of each person's work.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* A branch is a working copy of a master file. You work on the branch and then commit, and your changes are merged to the master and a new save point is created. You work on the branch so your master always works and you can always revert back.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* When you commit, you are committing changes and creating a save point for the master. Commit messages should be concise and specific in their description of the changes made since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict occurs when multiple changes have been made to the same block of code. The program doesn't know which version to use so you must manually review and approve changes.
