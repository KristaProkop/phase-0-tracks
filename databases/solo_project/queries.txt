Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
select * from customers;

Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
update customers set name="Frank Jones" where name = "Bob Jones";
update orders set filled="true" where id = 4;

Display the information in both tables using one query.
select * from orders, customers;

Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
#viewing customer name, order id, amount and filled status:
select customers.name, orders.id, orders.amount, orders.filled from orders join customers on orders.customer_id = customers.id;

Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
#cancel all orders made frank jones
DELETE FROM orders where customer_id=1;

#show customer name, order number, amount and status for only non-filled orders:
select customers.name, orders.id, orders.amount, orders.filled from orders join customers on orders.customer_id = customers.id WHERE orders.filled="false";
