Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

I plan to first google jquery resources to see what the most interesting sites that come up. In addition to straight technical resources like StackOverflow I will also look for blogs/editorials, because they are usually very enlightening. I will look for a jquery subreddit and then look at the sidebar to see if any great resources can be found there. 
Rather than stopping and testing what I've learned, I will probably test as I go. I'll take a break once an hour.
