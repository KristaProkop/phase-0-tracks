<!--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
Semantic tags are tags with names that precisely describe the element. At this point I suspect that <img>, <table>, <nav>, <figcaption> and <header/footer> are included in a large percentage of modern websites, since those elements are so fundamental to any site. My favorite is <nav> because it's much easier to find the nav in a page full of general lists!

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser renders the page in the order the elements appear in the html doc, unless otherwise altered with styles or scripts.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I was actually planning to look up whether it was possible to create my own snippets! I wanted to add a snippet for the responsive design viewport meta tag. Since we now know you can create your own snippets, I imagine Sublime has a whole host of customization features waiting to be discovered!

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
The most challenging concept was the placement of semantic elements. It seems like a lot to remember (eg x element must not be contained within y or z elements, or must appear before y and z on the page). I am planning to pore over html blogs this weekend to gain a better understanding of semantics and the logic behind their placement and uses.
