__An Elevator Usage Algorithm__
aka find_destination_floor 

(assuming destination_floor and current_floor = gets.chomp)

1.  begin process
    if destination_floor == current_floor
        --> exit find_destination_floor process and begin find_destination_unit process
2.  find elevator bank and proceed toward it
3.  upon reaching elevator bank, stop
4.  find elevator up/down buttons
    if destination_floor > current_floor 
        --> press up arrow button
5.  if destination_floor < current_floor 
        --> press down arrow button
6.  wait for elevator doors to open
7.  when elevator doors open, walk 3 steps into elevator
8.  turn around 180 degrees, stop
9.  find elevator number buttons 
10. find number button == destination_floor and press it
    if number button == destination_floor returns false
        --> exit find_destination_floor process and begin call_for_correct_address process
11. watch the floor indicator display
12. when floor indicator display == destination_floor AND elevator doors open, take 3 steps out of elevator
13. proceed to destination 
14. end process


__A Toothbrushing Algorithm__
aka brush_teeth

1.   begin process
     if acidic foods have been consumed in past 30 minutes, wait until 30 minutes have passed [[brushing too quickly weakens enamel!]]
2.   find toothbrush holder
3.   retrieve toothbrush from toothbrush holder
4.   turn on water and hold toothbrush head under running water
5.   turn off water
6.   pull out small drawer below the sink on the right side
7.   retrieve aquafresh from drawer
8.   flip open cap
9.   bring toothbrush up to the same height as the toothpaste
10.  squeeze toothpaste onto brush
11.  when toothpaste squirt length == bristle width stop squeezing
12.  replace toothpaste cap and place back in drawer
13.  close drawer
14.  bring toothbrush up to mouth 
15.  open mouth and insert toothbrush until touching teeth
16.  push toothbrush left
17.  push toothbrush right
18.  repeat 16 & 17 for two minutes
19.  remove toothbrush from mouth and position under faucet
20.  turn on water for 5 seconds then turn off
21.  shake excess water from toothbrush for 2 seconds
22.  replace toothbrush in holder
23.  end process
